# Hands-on-codepen
A pen is worth a thousand docs!

### In the journey of Front-end: 
    I consider that HTML CSS JS are so important to work on  
    The basics of front-end starts from these three. 
    So I started experimenting my codes at codepen and 
    will upload at Hands-on-codepen and explore as many as possible 
### Web Pages: 
    Learning I figured out that HTML >> CSS >> JS and then mastering 3 equally defines our skill as a front-end (in also making web pages)
    And backend is like extensions of these three "the frameworks" etc etc 
    Secret: front-end is more common among developers thesedays and backend deveplors are having salary perks considering the intricacy
